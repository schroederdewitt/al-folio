Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) has seen increasing interest across various disciplines, ranging from economics and 
epidemiology to cybersecurity, social sciences, and climate policy. 
At the same time, recent progress in AI has yielded exciting new approaches to learning, calibrating, and analysing 
such models, including deep multi-agent learning and simulation-based inference. 
This interdisciplinary community is meant to bring together practitioners and theorists to boost ABM method 
development in AI, and stimulate novel applications across disciplinary boundaries.


As part of the AI4ABM community, [Prof. Jakob Foerster’s lab](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) and 
[Prof. Ani Calinescu’s lab](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ani.calinescu/) are jointly starting a new 
interdisciplinary reading group on AI for Agent-Based Modelling. This Reading Group takes place on Thursdays at 
4:00-5:30pm GMT in LR-7, IEB, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford (UK). While we encourage in-person
attendance, we also facilitate remote participation via video call. If you wish to attend this Reading Group and 
become a member of the AI4ABM community, please subscribe to the 
[AI4ABM mailing list](mailto:ai4abm-subscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk). 
If you encounter any issues, please contact [us](mailto:cs@robots.ox.ac.uk).
We welcome anyone to attend and present!

If you would like to present at a future session, please let [us](mailto:cs@robots.ox.ac.uk) know the date and 
title of your presentation.

We are looking forward to meeting you :)

Best wishes,
